# RNDR WATCHTOWER
by Brendan Prednis

### About
This project is to imrpove reading the stats of the RNDR application that runs on RNDR nodes. 
Currently, the application only shows a little bit of information, and sometimes reading through log files can get boring.

### Purpose
This is an additional tool you can use along side the awesome web based setup rndr-stats.com. This project is directly influenced by it.

### Goals
The end goal is to be able to set up a real-time node count + a pub-sub system with all the nodes in your possession and your main monitoring node. 
This is a really lofty goal, but I really enjoy interacting with the community and would really like to use this tool myself.


### Notes 
This project was directly influenced by rndr-stats.com and the RNDR Watchdog script. I have spent many hours reading through the watchdog script, understanding where and why things are being called, and looking at the source code for the rndr-stats.com website in order to gain a better understanding of how things are being displayed.
